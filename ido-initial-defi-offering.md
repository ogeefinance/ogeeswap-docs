# IDO (Initial DeFi Offering)
##### Buy new tokens with a brand new token sale model

## Intro

Buy new tokens using OGE-HT LP tokens.

The project gets the BNB, OgeeSwap burns the OGE. You get the tokens.

You will need OGE-HT LP tokens to participate.
OGE tokens equating to half of the total funds raised will be burned forever: If the full 1,000,000 USD allocation is raised, then  500,000 USD of OGE tokens will be burned.

### Step 1: Before Sale:
Buy OGE and HT tokens.

Get OGE-HT LP tokens by adding OGE and HT liquidity.

[Buy OGE](https://ogee.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=HT&outputCurrency=0x81c3BB76508BB4668fD38DDA71655972F4a3526F) [Get LP tokens](https://ogee.exchange/#/add/HT/0x81c3BB76508BB4668fD38DDA71655972F4a3526F)

### Step 2: During Sale:
While the sale is live, commit your OGE-LP tokens to buy the IDO tokens.


### Step 3: After Sale:
Claim the tokens you bought, along with any unspent funds.
Done!


> If you decide to acquire OGE-HT LP tokens before the IDO starts, you can stake them in the [OGE-HT Farm](https://ogeeswap.com/) to earn OGE token rewards while waiting for the sale.


> While you are holding OGE-HT LP tokens you will be at risk of Impermanent Loss.



## What is the “Overflow” sale method?
TLDR: Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.


In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IDO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

> It's possible to receive no tokens at all: If you commit a very small amount of LP tokens compared to the total amount committed by others, your contribution may be such a small part of the total that you may not qualify for even a small portion of the tokens sold.
In such a case, you will still be able to reclaim all the OGE-HT LP tokens you committed.



## What happens if the IDO doesn't raise all the funds targeted?
The sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent.


## Want to launch your own IDO?
Launch your project with OgeeSwap, Huobi ECO Chain’s most-used AMM project and liquidity provider, to bring your token directly to the most active and rapidly growing community on BSC.

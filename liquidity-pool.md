# Liquidity Pools and Adding Liquidity

OgeeSwap pools allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or “LPs”.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool \(LP\), you will receive OgeeSwap LP tokens \(OgeeSwap’s version of liquidity provider tokens\).

As an example, if you deposited $OYT and $HT into a liquidity pool, you would receive OYT-HT OgeeSwap LP tokens.

The number of OgeeSwap LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the OYT-HT liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss. “Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.”

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades OgeeSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 OgeeSwap LP tokens representing 10 OYT/Any HRC20 tokens and 10 HT tokens.
* 1 OgeeSwap LP token = 1 OYT + 1 HT
* Someone trades 10 OYT for 10 HT.
* Someone else trades 10 HT for 10 OYT.
* The OYT/HT liquidity pool now has 10.017 OYT and 10.017 HT.
* Each OgeeSwap LP token is now worth 1.00017 OYT + 1.00017 HT.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your OgeeSwap LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the OYT farms \(here\), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.

* We are taking OYT an example.

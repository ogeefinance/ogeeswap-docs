The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in "Pools". In exchange, they get OgeeSwap LP (OgeeSwap Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn OYT tokens in the "farm".

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a 0.2% trading fee, which is broken down as follows:

0.17% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

0.03% - Sent to the OgeeSwap Treasury.

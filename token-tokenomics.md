# How will OYT release and distribute?

OYT tokens will be gradually released to liquidity pools according to their respective reward multiplier (e.g. 5x, 10x, etc).


Early farmers (or as we like to think of them, early “farmers”) will be greatly rewarded in terms of the initial OYT per block release.
